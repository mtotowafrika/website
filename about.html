          Who we are
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mtoto W’afrika Child Care Ministries was founded in 2013 by Samuel
          Sekibejja. In 2014, we received our fully incorporated NGO status. Our
          path toward transformation is hinged on the willingness and hope to
          spread the unconditional love of Jesus Christ to the next generation
          of future leaders in the hard-to-reach communities in Uganda, South
          Sudan, and East Africa.
        </p>

        <p>
          This has been the greatest motivation behind the beautiful journey of
          the organization. Additionally, we focus on making a child
          well-rounded by providing education, computers, farming, animal
          caretaking, sewing, and various other life skills opportunities. Mtoto
          W’afrika Child Care Ministries also provides medical care to the
          children, their families, and the communities that it serves. The
          dream to develop these future leaders will be achieved by empowering
          the children through spiritual, educational, and mental development
          growth. Currently, we have reached over 2,000 children in Uganda and
          South Sudan with these growth milestones.<br />

            Samuel Sekibejja understands the challenges that these vulnerable
            children and families face. He has walked in their shoes as a youth
            himself and he knows the value of a Christian organization taking a
            child under its wings and developing him or her into a valued
            leader. Out of his experience, Mtoto W’afrika Child Care Ministries
            was born and will continue to foster the same love of Jesus and
            offer opportunities for vulnerable children and the communities.
            Mtoto W’afrika Child Care Ministries has a wonderful team of devoted
            staff that has a strong desire to share the love of Jesus Christ and
            help the youth to develop into strong and resilient leaders. We look
            forward to you visiting our website and we pray you will partner
            with us. As always, please pray for us and the children.

          Guiding Principles
        </h2>

        <p>
          Being Community Led is at the heart of what we do and what we believe.
          We aim to empower local people to be active in their own development
          and to make a difference in their own communities. We have a fantastic
          team of volunteers who give up their time and energy to volunteer in
          their local communities every week and we could not do what we do
          without them. We are also passionate about being Community Driven. All
          the ideas for our programmes and projects come from the communities
          themselves. We believe in asking people what their needs are and how
          best we can help them, and giving people the space to come up with
          creative solutions themselves.<br />

            <strong class="fw-bold"> Accountability and Transparency</strong> is
            very important to our organisation and the work that we do. We take
            bribery and corruption very seriously and do not tolerate any such
            activities. We aim to always be as clear as possible about
            management of projects and finances.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="fw-bold"> Communicating Clearly</strong> about our
            projects and activities, as well as communicating impacts and
            stories about individuals and communities, who have benefitted from
            our work, ties into accountability and transparency. We communicate
            regularly about our work to donors, supporters and friends,
            beneficiaries, staff and volunteers and keep nothing hidden from
            anyone. However, some of our information is confidential and we need

            believe that it is very important to thank supporters as often as is
            necessary. We believe in putting children first and aiming to meet
