        <p>
          Mtoto W’afrika Child Care Ministries was founded in 2013 and fully
          incorporated with an NGO status in 2014. Our path towards
          transformation is hinged on the willingness and hope to spread the
          unconditional love of Jesus Christ to the next generation of leaders
          in the hard-to-reach communities in Uganda and across borders. This
          has been the greatest fuel behind the beautiful journey of the
          organization. The dream to actualize this leader is achieved through
          empowering this child through all the phases of growth. The heart of
          this started through the “SANYUKA” program in Luwero District, where
          the long life impact was to put those big smiles on these
          children.This has grown overtime into a full program under the core
          thematic area of education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our founder (Mr. Samuel Sekibejja) has lived this reality having been
          groomed by people of good will who were compelled to give a ray of
          hope to the less privileged. Together with a wonderful team whose
          minds were aligned in the same direction, Mtoto W’Afrika was born to
          continue shading a ray of hope to such people and this is a vision
          that we continue to pursue for life.

        <p>
          Being Community Led is at the heart of what we do and what we believe.
          We aim to empower local people to be active in their own development
          and to make a difference in their own communities. We have a fantastic
          team of volunteers who give up their time and energy to volunteer in
          their local communities every week and we could not do what we do
          without them. We are also passionate about being Community Driven. All
          the ideas for our programmes and projects come from the communities
          themselves. We believe in asking people what their needs are and how
          best we can help them, and giving people the space to come up with
          creative solutions themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="fw-bold"> Accountability and Transparency</strong> is
          very important to our organisation and the work that we do. We take
          bribery and corruption very seriously and do not tolerate any such
          activities. We aim to always be as clear as possible about management
          of projects and finances, and our reports and accounts are available
          for public view should anyone wish to see them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="fw-bold"> Communicating Clearly</strong> about our
          projects and activities, as well as communicating impacts and stories
          about individuals and communities, who have benefitted from our work,
          ties into accountability and transparency. We communicate regularly
          about our work to donors, supporters and friends, beneficiaries, staff
          and volunteers and keep nothing hidden from anyone. However, some of
          our information is confidential and we need to keep this secure to
          protect children and other beneficiaries. Please refer to our Data
          Protection Policy for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="fw-bold">Support Appreciation</strong> is also one of
          our core principles. We are extremely grateful to everyone who have
          volunteered, donated, sponsored or supported us any way and we believe
          that it is very important to thank supporters as often as is
          necessary. We believe in putting children first and aiming to meet
          their needs as we are working with extremely vulnerable children.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="fw-bold">Child Protection</strong> is crucial and all
          volunteers need to read and abide by our Child Protection Policy at
          all times.
