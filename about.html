        <p>
          Mtoto W’afrika Child Care Ministries was founded in 2013 and fully
          incorporated with an NGO status in 2014. Our path towards
          transformation is hinged on the willingness and hope to spread the
          unconditional love of Jesus Christ to the next generation of leaders
          in the hard-to-reach communities in Uganda and across borders. This
          has been the greatest fuel behind the beautiful journey of the
          organization. The dream to actualize this leader is achieved through
          empowering this child through all the phases of growth. The heart of
          this started through the “SANYUKA” program in Luwero District, where
          the long life impact was to put those big smiles on these
          children.This has grown overtime into a full program under the core
          thematic area of education.

          Our founder (Mr. Samuel Sekibejja) has lived this reality having been
          groomed by people of good will who were compelled to give a ray of
          hope to the less privileged. Together with a wonderful team whose
          minds were aligned in the same direction, Mtoto W’Afrika was born to
          continue shading a ray of hope to such people and this is a vision
          that we continue to pursue for life.
