        <p>
          Children's activities: We want to allow disadvantaged children the
          chance to just enjoy being children, to play and have fun away from
          the stresses and worries of their everyday lives. We do this through
          playing sports and games, singing songs, sharing a message of hope
          through Bible stories, and lots of other fun activities to empower the
          children and to let them know that they are loved and that we care for
          them. Supporting Basic Needs projects: Many of the children who attend
          Mtoto W’afrika Child Care ministries are in desperate need of vital
          requirements and lack basic services. To meet these needs, we hold
          giveaways of essential items for the children at all of our areas of
          operation, including food, clothes, shoes, school supplies, soap,
          toothbrushes and toothpaste, mosquito nets and more. Feeding
          programme: We provide a hot nutritious meal for all the children at
          all of our Mtoto W’afrika centers as funds avails. Many of the
          children are under- nourished and their parents struggle to feed them.
          We are aiming to tackle malnutrition and our Feeding Programme is
          making a big difference to children's health and well-being. School
          Sponsorship Programme: We support the neediest children who would
          otherwise grow up without an education to go to school through
          matching children with Sponsors. This enables them to go to school and
          grow up with a good education and have a bright future. Music and
          Dance: We have several music and dance groups who practice very hard
          and are learning singing, traditional Ugandan dancing, modern dancing,
          drama, drumming and other musical instruments. The children are very
          talented and perform at various functions to have fun and raise
          awareness. Football projects: Each MCCM centre has very talented
          football teams that are practicing hard and are being coached by our
          volunteers. We regularly hold matches between different teams and
          other organisations, and these are great fun and very encouraging for
          the boys. Educational Support projects: Along side our children's
          activities, we run after school coaching sessions, helping children
          with their homework and school work, and also supporting and working
          with the children who don't attend school yet and helping them to
          catch up so that they will not fall too far behind. Women's
          Initiatives: Each of our centres has a women's initiative project,
          bringing together women from the community to learn vocational skills.
          We teach the women how to make various craft items which they then
          sell to gain a sustainable income for their families and also helping
          them start saving schemes to gain financial independency. Community
          Development projects: Our idea as MCCM is seeing a generation where
          the community is highly resourceful and able to afford all the basic
          necessities of life and this through a number of Projects that are
          aimed at providing a sustainable solutions to community challenges
          like hunger and poverty through providing food and a sustainable
          source of income for poor communities. Our current projects running
          include simsim growing and skilling of the community with IGA’S like
          liquid soap and sanitizer making, tailoring for school dropout
          adolescents etc. Vulnerable Girls projects: We are supporting
          vulnerable girls through education, allowing them a safe space to
          discuss ideas, ask difficult questions, and receive emotional support,
          and through supporting their basic needs such as sanitary pads.
          Currently we are into fusing an element of sustainability through the
          skilling project where the girls are taken through a phased learning
          process on how to knit reusable sanitary pads. Partnerships We work in
          partnership with local schools, local community authorities, other
          development partner organizations and churches in Uganda to ensure
          that the children are supported in all areas of their lives and to see
          whole communities becoming involved and taking ownership of this
          project. We are always looking for like-minded organisations and
          individuals who would be interested in partnering with us and our
          projects. Future Plans Our aim for the future is to not only sustain
          current activities, but to grow further in love, impact, size and
          sustainable finances. There remains a lot more that we would like to
          accomplish and areas in which we would like to expand all of our
          programmes. We have the systems in place and many willing volunteers
          to help, but we currently lack the finances to expand our work. In
          particular, we would like to open and run new MCCM ECDC, reaching more
          children and communities; and to ensure a constant supply of play
          equipment, food, clothes and other essential items to bring love and
          joy into the little lives of the children that we serve. We would like
          to see the number of children on our School Sponsorship programme
          increase, many more Community Development projects set up, and to
          expand our health programme to support more children with severe
          medical needs. We also have plans to help support and develop the
          communities that we are working in, particularly in the areas of clean
          water, health and sanitation. We are hoping to build new toilets, dig
          boreholes and clean up water systems and are currently looking for
          organisations to partner with to achieve this. We are also hoping to
          set up and run health clinics, a pre-primary school and a full primary
          school in the future and vaccination centers, and again are looking
          for partners to help us to make this a reality. Another of our hopes
          for the future is to be able to purchase a truck to run a mobile Mtoto
          W’afrika Child Care ministries, to reach needier children and
          undertake more giveaways of essential items that in even the remotest
          of areas. In particular, we would like to reach, bringing hope, joy
          and love, and provide
