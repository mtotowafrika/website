       <div class="pt-5 programbody">
          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle">Children's activities:</h3> We
          want to allow disadvantaged children the chance to just enjoy being
          children, to play and have fun away from the stresses and worries of
          their everyday lives. We do this through playing sports and games,
          singing songs, sharing a message of hope through Bible stories, and
          lots of other fun activities to empower the children and to let them
          know that they are loved and that we care for them.

            >Supporting Basic Needs projects:</h3
          >
          Many of the children who attend Mtoto W’afrika Child Care ministries
          are in desperate need of vital requirements and lack basic services.
          To meet these needs, we hold giveaways of essential items for the
          children at all of our areas of operation, including food, clothes,
          shoes, school supplies, soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste, mosquito
          nets and more.
        </div>
       <div class="pt-5 programbody">
          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle">Feeding programme:</h3> We
          provide a hot nutritious meal for all the children at all of our Mtoto
          W’afrika centers as funds avails. Many of the children are under-
          nourished and their parents struggle to feed them. We are aiming to
          tackle malnutrition and our Feeding Programme is making a big
          difference to children's health and well-being.

          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle"
            >School Sponsorship Programme:</h3
          >
          We support the neediest children who would otherwise grow up without
          an education to go to school through matching children with Sponsors.
          This enables them to go to school and grow up with a good education
          and have a bright future.
        </div>
       <div class="pt-5 programbody">
          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle">Music and Dance:</h3> We have
          several music and dance groups who practice very hard and are learning
          singing, traditional Ugandan dancing, modern dancing, drama, drumming
          and other musical instruments. The children are very talented and
          perform at various functions to have fun and raise awareness.
        </div>
       <div class="pt-5 programbody">
          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle">Football projects:</h3> Each MCCM
          centre has very talented football teams that are practicing hard and
          are being coached by our volunteers. We regularly hold matches between
          different teams and other organisations, and these are great fun and
          very encouraging for the boys. Educational Support projects: Along
          side our children's activities, we run after school coaching sessions,
          helping children with their homework and school work, and also
          supporting and working with the children who don't attend school yet
          and helping them to catch up so that they will not fall too far
          behind.

       <div class="pt-5 programbody">
          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle">Women's Initiatives:</h3> Each of
          our centres has a women's initiative project, bringing together women
          from the community to learn vocational skills. We teach the women how
          to make various craft items which they then sell to gain a sustainable
          income for their families and also helping them start saving schemes
          to gain financial independency.

          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle"
            >Community Development projects:
          </h3>
          Our idea as MCCM is seeing a generation where the community is highly
          resourceful and able to afford all the basic necessities of life and
          this through a number of Projects that are aimed at providing a
          sustainable solutions to community challenges like hunger and poverty
          through providing food and a sustainable source of income for poor
          communities. Our current projects running include simsim growing and
          skilling of the community with IGA’S like liquid soap and sanitizer
          making, tailoring for school dropout adolescents etc.
        </div>
       <div class="pt-5 programbody">
          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle">Vulnerable Girls projects:</h3>
          We are supporting vulnerable girls through education, allowing them a
          safe space to discuss ideas, ask difficult questions, and receive
          emotional support, and through supporting their basic needs such as
          sanitary pads. Currently we are into fusing an element of
          sustainability through the skilling project where the girls are taken
          through a phased learning process on how to knit reusable sanitary
          pads.
        </div>
       <div class="pt-5 programbody">
          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle">Partnerships</h3> We work in
          partnership with local schools, local community authorities, other
          development partner organizations and churches in Uganda to ensure
          that the children are supported in all areas of their lives and to see
          whole communities becoming involved and taking ownership of this
          project. We are always looking for like-minded organisations and
          individuals who would be interested in partnering with us and our
          projects.
        </div>
       <div class="pt-5 programbody">
          <h3 class="fw-bold programtitle">Future Plans</h3> Our aim for the
          future is to not only sustain current activities, but to grow further
          in love, impact, size and sustainable finances. There remains a lot
          more that we would like to accomplish and areas in which we would like
          to expand all of our programmes. We have the systems in place and many
          willing volunteers to help, but we currently lack the finances to
          expand our work. In particular, we would like to open and run new MCCM
          ECDC, reaching more children and communities; and to ensure a constant
          supply of play equipment, food, clothes and other essential items to
          bring love and joy into the little lives of the children that we
          serve. We would like to see the number of children on our School
          Sponsorship programme increase, many more Community Development
          projects set up, and to expand our health programme to support more
          children with severe medical needs. We also have plans to help support
          and develop the communities that we are working in, particularly in
          the areas of clean water, health and sanitation. We are hoping to
          build new toilets, dig boreholes and clean up water systems and are
          currently looking for organisations to partner with to achieve this.
          We are also hoping to set up and run health clinics, a pre-primary
          school and a full primary school in the future and vaccination
          centers, and again are looking for partners to help us to make this a
          reality. Another of our hopes for the future is to be able to purchase
          a truck to run a mobile Mtoto W’afrika Child Care ministries, to reach
          needier children and undertake more giveaways of essential items that
          in even the remotest of areas. In particular, we would like to reach,
          bringing hope, joy and love, and provide

            Mtoto W’afrika Child Care Ministries was founded in 2013. We are
